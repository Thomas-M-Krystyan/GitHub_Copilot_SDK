# Description

This is a technical demo presenting the structure, workflow, and features
of [**GitHub Copilot SDK**](https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk) such as:

- basic LLM requests,
- streamed LLM responses,
- system messages,
- conversational loop with LLM model,
- `tools` + use cases,
- `mcp` + use cases,
- multi-agent application

# Prerequisites

The demo was prepared using `GitHub.Copilot.SDK` for `.NET` in version `0.1.19`,
and with a _Pro Plan_ **GitHub Copilot subscription**.

Some models might not be working with a _Free_ **GitHub Copilot subscription**:

> For example, _Claude Sonnet 4.5_ was used during the demo, and back then, it was not available in a _Free_ plan.

Change models incompatible with your subscription to another available model using a valid **model identifier** (e.g., "_gpt-4o_", "_gpt-4.1_", or "_gpt-5-mini_").
